\chapter{Torquer Drive Circuit}

The energy to flip the torquers is stored in a capacitor that is slowly charged from the power supply and discharged quickly into a torque coil. There are three capacitors, one for each axis. 

\section{Capicitor Charging}

Figure \cref{fig:cap-chg} shows the charging circuit. The resistor limits the current from the power supply to a maximum of ?? mA. A switch is shown instead of the H-bridge for simplicity.

\section{Rational}

A resistor was chosen for the charging circuit because it is simple and robust. The main drawback of the design is that it is about 50\% efficient. The capacitor voltage also depends on the supply voltage which will vary with battery discharge depth. 

\section{H-Bridge}

The H-bridge allows current to be driven in both directions through the torquer coils.
