The work in this thesis would not be possible without help and support from others. The CubeSat renderings for this thesis were primarily done by Patrick Wade with help from the rest of the \acs{ARC} mechanical team. The \aclp{SPB} were designed by Morgan Jonsen and Chic O'Dell. Most of the boards on the test setup were populated by Chic O'Dell. I would like to thank Dr. Hawkins and Dr. Thorsen for their support of projects that I have worked on over the years. The work in this thesis was supported by the \acl{ASGP}.
