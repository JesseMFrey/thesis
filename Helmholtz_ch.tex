\chapter{Helmholtz Cage}

\label{ch:BG}

\Cref{fig:helmholtz} shows a Helmholtz cage that was constructed in 2009 to facilitate testing of systems for the \ac{ARC}. The Helmholtz cage has the ability, under MATLAB control, to generate a magnetic field in any direction.

The computer controlled field allows the calibration and testing process to be automated. The field can be swept through a range of field values and measurements can be taken at each point without human intervention. Once the measurements are complete they can be processed in MATLAB to get immediate results.
