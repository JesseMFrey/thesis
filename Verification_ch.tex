\chapter{Verification}

\label{ch:Verification}

The \ac{ACDS} consists of experimental hardware controlled by experimental software and as such requires a significant amount of verification to make sure everything functions on orbit. Ideally everything would be verified before launch but, it is difficult to replicate the on-orbit environment closely. The magnetic field can be effectively simulated using the Helmholtz cage so the sensors can be calibrated and tested. 

\section{Motivation}

The \acp{LPMT} used for the \ac{ACDS} pose a unique challenge when compared to other magnetic torquers used previously, they switch but can't be switched off. Magnetometer measurements are used for attitude determination but the field from the torquers, if not compensated for, will overwhelm the Earth's magnetic field making attitude determination impossible.

\subsection{Torquer offsets}


\afterpage{\begin{landscape}

    \label{fig:b-offset}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}}



The magnetic field of the earth ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 Gauss\cite[pp.~114]{Wertz}. In order to measure the attitude of the \ac{ARC} to within {\textpm5\textdegree} the Earth's magnetic field must be measured with an error of less than 26~mGauss. This means that the offsets from the torquers must be known with an accuracy of at least 26~mGauss. 

Because of the nature of the dipole magnetic field, the offsets measured by each magnetometer are unique to each magnetometer and torquer combination. Some torquers have only a small effect on each magnetometer and some have a much larger effect. \Cref{fig:b-offset} shows the magnetic field offsets with the torquers in various states. 

To visualize the torquer offsets the torquer compensation data, explained in \cref{sec:tq-comp}, is used. The \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$offsetplot$ function is used to plot the changes in torquer offset. The offset part of the compensation data is plotted with respect to torquer state.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=code,caption={Plotting torquer offsets from compensation data},label={lst:off-plot},language=Matlab]
offsetplot(cors,cor_spb);
\end{lstlisting}

\Cref{lst:off-plot} shows how to generate the offset plot. The first argument to \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$offsetplot$ is a cell array containing the compensation data to plot. This is the same as is returned by the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$store_all_cal$ function shown in \cref{lst:st-cal}. The seccond argument is a cell array of the names of the \acp{SPB} for witch the calibration was done. In addition to generating a plot of the compensation data the information in \cref{tab:off-stat} is printed.

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Information from \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$offsetplot$}
    \label{tab:off-stat}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        \acs{SPB}&Max Offset&Min Offset&Deviation\\

        \hline
        Y+&606.78&-2364.76&2971.54\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\Cref{tab:off-stat} shows the offset max and min's. The deviation is the diffrence between the max and min and is an indication of how much of an affect the torquers have on the magnetometers. The greatest deviation is just over 5~Gauss for the Y+ \ac{SPB} measuring the X-axis. The Y+ \ac{SPB} also has the second highest deviation of almost 3~Gauss. The Y- and Z+ \acp{SPB} have deviations that are closer to 1~Gauss. Looking back at \cref{fig:torquers} it makes sense that the Y+ \ac{SPB} has the largest torquer offset as it is located close to a pair of X torquers and a pair of Z-torquers. The Y- \ac{SPB} is located next to the header so the torquers are located a bit farther away. The Z+ board is located farthest away from the torquers so one would expect that the offsets for it might be significantly smaller.


\Cref{fig:b-offset,tab:off-stat} show the necessity of torquer compensation. There are large variations in the measured magnetic field due to the torquers changing state the largest is over 5~gauss. Without torquer compensation the magnetic field from the torquers would completely overwhelm the torquers and make attitude determination impossible. What \Cref{fig:b-offset} does not show is how repeatable the offsets are which determines if compensation is possible.

\subsection{Torquer Repeatability}

\afterpage{\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}[p]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{torqueOffsets}
    \caption{Box Plot from torquer offset test}
    \label{fig:tqoff}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}}

The torquer compensation method depends on the torquer offsets being repeatable. If the offsets are not very repeatable then the offsets will induce errors in the measured field. \Cref{fig:tqoff} shows a plot of the torquer offsets. The plot shows the offsets of the torquers when they are polarized in each direction. The offset for both of the magnetometer axes are shown. The offset values are normalized to show deviation from the median for better comparison. The maximum offset variation in \cref{fig:tqoff} is 20 mGauss.


%The offset variations shown in \cref{fig:tqoff} are all less than the maximum error from \cref{fig:tqerr}. This is likely because the maximum offsets did not occur all at the same time.

The plot in \cref{fig:tqoff} was generated using the code in \cref{lst:tqoff}. To create the plot each torquer was flipped 20 times in each direction. After each flip a magnetometer calibration was done to get the offset values. (more description to follow when I find the code again)

\section{Magnetometer Verification}

There are several steps to the magnetometer on a \ac{SPB} calibrated and verified. First the board is tested separate from the rest of the CubeSat. Next the \ac{SPB} is attached to the CubeSat and the torquer compensation routine is run to calculate the torquer offsets. Finally the compensation values are transfered to the \ac{ACDS} board and the compensation is verified.


\subsection{Initial Verification}

The magnetometer verification is done using the Helmholtz cage. A calibration is run on a board separate from the CubeSat. The calculations are done on the calibration coefficients so that they can be compared to the datasheet values to check if the magnetometers are preforming as they should. Problems are often caused by bad solder joints which can cause one or more axis to be unresponsive.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=code,caption={\ac{SPB} verification},label={lst:vspb},language=Matlab]
spbMag('X+','COM3',9600,-95.3,1);
\end{lstlisting}

\Cref{lst:vspb} shows how to verify the X+ \ac{SPB}. This will run a calibration on the magnetometer and compare the calibration values to datasheet parameters. The first argument is the address of the \ac{SPB} board this can be a symbolic address, as shown, or a numeric address (still in string form). The second and third arguments define the COM port and baud rate respectively of the serial port to use to connect to the microcontroller attached to the \ac{SPB}. The fourth and fifth parameters are the gains for the amplifier and \ac{ADC}. The amplifier gain is only used to get the expected scale factor for the magnetometer but the \ac{ADC} gain also sets the gain of the \ac{ADC} while the measurements are being taken.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={\ac{SPB} verification results},label={lst:vspb-res},language=verbatim]
TODO: run command and collect ouput
\end{lstlisting}

\Cref{lst:vspb-res} shows the output from the \ac{SPB} verification. The calculated datasheet parameters are shown along with pass or fail depending on if the values are within the maximums specified by the datasheet.


\subsection{Torquer Compensation}

\label{sec:tq-comp}

The torquer compensation for the X+ \ac{SPB} is shown in \cref{lst:tq-comp-gen}. The arguments to \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$calall$ are the same as those for \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$spbMag$ except this time a rotation matrix is passed that rotates from the Helmholtz cage axis to the \ac{SPB} axis.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=code,caption={Torquer compensation for the X+ \ac{SPB}},label={lst:tq-comp-gen},language=Matlab]
a = [0 0 1;-1 0 0;0 1 0];
cor=calall('X+','COM3',9600,-95.3,1,a);
\end{lstlisting}

The \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$calall$ function internally calls \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$tCal$ three times. Each time the X, Y or Z torquers are flipped to generate a partial calibration. Once the calibrations are complete the calibrations are combined to get one data set for all torquers.

\subsection{Compensation Testing}

The torquer compensation is tested using the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$tCalTstFull$ function. The function runs the Helmholtz Cage through a field sequence and takes measurements at each point. During the process a random torquer is flipped every 10 data points. The measurements are corrected, in Matlab, using the compensation data set and compared to the expected field. A plot of the Y+ test data is shown in \cref{fig:tqtst}. The RMS error is also calculated for the data set so the effectiveness of the torquer compensation can be compared to the calibration without torquers.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=code,caption={Running torquer compensation test for the X+ \ac{SPB}},label={lst:tCalTst},language=Matlab]
a = [0 0 1;-1 0 0;0 1 0];
tCalTstFull('X+',cor,'COM3',57600,-95.3,1,a);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{torqueCalTst}
  \caption{Y+ torquer compensation test showing that the correction provides a large amount of improvement over the uncorrected values}
    \label{fig:tqtst}
\end{figure}

\Cref{lst:tCalTst} shows how to run the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$tCalTstFull$ function. The first argument to the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$tCalTstFull$ function is the address of the \ac{SPB} to use. The address can be specified as a number or, more continently, as a symbolic name that resolves to the correct address. The seccond argument is the correction that was previously calculated using the calall function. The third and fourth arguments are the serial port and buad rate to use to talk to the CubeSat. The fifth argument is the gain of the amplifier on the \ac{SPB} this is not really used for the calibration test because the gain is factored into the correction data. The 6th argument is the \ac{ADC} gain, this gain has already been factored into the calibration but it must be set correctly in the \ac{ADC} for the test to work properly. The last argument is the rotation matrix  The function needs a rotation matrix to transform from \ac{SPB} coordinates to Helmholtz cage coordinates. The code generates the magnetic field and plots the results in the \ac{SPB} plane.

\afterpage{\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}[p]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{torqueCalTst-err}
    \caption{Graph showing Y+ torquer compensation error plot}
    \label{fig:tqerr}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}}

\Cref{fig:tqerr} shows the error for the torquer compensation test. The RMS error for the compensated data is 20 mGauss. The maximum error is 38 mGauss. The RMS error is less than the 20~mGauss to get {\textpm5\textdegree} error but the maximum error of 38~mGauss is much higher. This is likely due to, in part, to the Y+ \ac{SPB} being in a location that gives it an offset swing of almost 3~Gauss.

%\Cref{fig:tqerr} shows the error for the torquer compensation test. The RMS error for the compensated data is 9 mGauss. The maximum error is 24 mGauss. On a 300 mGauss field a 24 mGauss error will cause an angular error of \textpm5\textdegree. The addition of the torquers causes an increase in the RMS and maximum error.
%This can be seen by comparing \cref{fig:tqerr} with \cref{fig:magerr}. In \cref{fig:tqerr} steps in the error are seen as torquers are flipped whereas in \cref{fig:magerr} the error is more consistent across the entire run.

\subsection{Compensation Data Transfer}

The compensation data set is generated in Matlab but to be used in flight it must be stored on the \ac{ACDS} board. The calibration data is stored in the flash memory on the \ac{ACDS} microcontroller. The on-board flash has the benefit of reading the same as \ac{RAM} and is also more abundant but is a bit disruptive to write. This works well in the case of the \ac{ACDS} because the data is expected to be written once but read often. The other option would be to store the data on the \ac{SD} that is used to log data. In this case the calibration data would need to be buffered in \ac{RAM} which is much more limited than the flash. 

The main flash memory is divided into sectors that are 512 bytes long. Erasing is done on a full sector so the corection data for each \ac{SPB} is stored in its own sector. The correction data is 408 bytes long the header and \ac{CRC} that are stored with the correction data take up 4 bytes leaving 100 bytes wasted. This is not a big deal as there is an abundance of flash.

Before the correction data is sent to the \ac{ACDS} it must be repackaged this is done using the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$make_cor_dat$ function. Correction data is transfered as single precision IEEE~754 floating point numbers. Because both the \ac{ACDS} processor and most of the machines commonly used to run Matlab are little endian machines, the byte order for the transfered data is little endian. It is important to note that in both ends of the transfer no effort is made to make sure that the data order is correct so this needs to be taken into account if the endianness of one of the machines changes.

The data generated with \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$make_cor_dat$ is temporally stored in the \ac{SD} on the \ac{ACDS} board. The data is stored with an identifier that includes which \ac{SPB} the data is for. On the \ac{ACDS} board the data is unpacked from the \ac{SD}, reformatted slightly, and stored in the on-board flash. 

To simplify the process of generating a calibration set the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$store_all_cal$ function was written. The \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$store_all_cal$ function generates correction data for all \ac{SPB} boards, sends the data to the \ac{ACDS} and tells the \ac{ACDS} to store the data in flash. 

\begin{lstlisting}[style=code,caption={Generating and sending compensation data to the \ac{ACDS}},label={lst:st-cal},language=Matlab]
cors=store_all_cal('COM3',57600,-95.3,1);
\end{lstlisting}

\Cref{lst:st-cal} shows how \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$store_all_cal$ is called. The arguments are COM port, baud rate, amplifier gain, and \ac{ADC} gain which are the same as previously discussed. The compensation data for each \ac{SPB} is returned in a cell array so that compensation testing can be done in Matlab if desired.

\subsection{Embedded Compensation Testing}

The test in \cref{fig:tqtst,fig:tqerr} only used the \ac{ACDS} embedded system to flip torquers and take measurements. To Matlab was used to do all of the calculations for the calibration. During the flight the calibration must be done on-board with the embedded system on the \ac{ACDS} board.

To test the embedded calibration the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$tCalTstMSP_all$ function is used. To run the test the completed CubeSat (or representation), with compensation data stored on the \ac{ACDS} processor, is placed in the Helmholtz cage. The magnetic field is swept through a field sequence. At every point in the sequence the magnetic field is measured by and after every 10 points a random torquer is flipped in each axis. The calibrated total magnetic field values as well as the calibrated values from each \ac{SPB} are read by Matlab and the results are plotted as shown in \cref{fig:tcalMSP,fig:tcalMSPerr,fig:tcalMSPerr-axis}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=code,caption={Testing the on-board calibration},label={lst:st-MSPcal},language=Matlab]
tCalTstMSP_all('COM3',57600);
\end{lstlisting}

\Cref{lst:st-MSPcal} shows an example of the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$tCalTstMSP_all$ function being used. The two arguments shown are the COM port and baud rate as discussed before. A rotation matrix can be supplied as a \nth{3} argument. The rotation matrix only rotates the field generated by the Helmholtz cage as it is assumed that the CubeSat axes are aligned with the Helmholtz cage axes.

\Cref{fig:tcalMSP} shows the torquer calibration test using the Y+, Y- and Z+ \acp{SPB} with the calibration performed using the embedded system on the \ac{ACDS} board. The RMS error was 14.637793~mGauss. The maximum error was 39.054539~mGauss.

\Cref{fig:tcalMSPerr} shows the errors for each sample as well as the torquer states during the samples. The large jumps in the errors all correspond with torquer flips.

\Cref{fig:tcalMSPerr-axis} shows the errors from each board in each axis.

\Cref{tab:tcalMSPerr} shows the RMS errors in table form. The N\\As in the table are because each \ac{SPB} only measures in two axes. For each axis the total error is less than the lowest error from a single axis. This indicates that having multiple measurements of the magnetic field reduces the overall error.

\section{B-dot controller simulations}

To verify the B-dot algorithm the \ac{ACDS} is placed in the Helmholtz cage and a rotating field is generated. The minimum rotation rate of the magnetic field that will cause a rotation rate is calculated by starting with \cref{eq:bdot-cross}

\begin{equation}
    \dot{\vec{B}} = \vec{B} \cross \omega
    \label{eq:bdot-cross}
\end{equation}

If the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the field rotation then \cref{eq:bdot-cross} becomes \cref{eq:bdot-mul}

\begin{equation}
    \dot{\vec{B}} = \left| \vec{B} \right| \cdot \left| \omega \right|
    \label{eq:bdot-mul}
\end{equation}

The B-dot algorithm equation is shown in \cref{eq:bdot-alg}.

\begin{equation}
    M_{cmd} = C \dot{\vec{B}} 
    \label{eq:bdot-alg}
\end{equation}

Substituting \cref{eq:bdot-mul} into \cref{eq:bdot-alg} and solving for $\omega$ gives \cref{eq:omega-th}. Where $M_{th}$ is the torque switching threshold for the torquers and $\omega_{th}$ is the minimum rotation rate required to flip a torquer.

\afterpage{\begin{landscape}
\begin{figure}[p]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{detumble-sim}
  \caption{Simulation of torquer output with spinning magnetic field}
    \label{fig:detumble-sim}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}}

\begin{equation}
    \omega _ {th} = {M _ {th} \over{ {C \left| \vec{B} \right|}}}
    \label{eq:omega-th}
\end{equation}

If a 0.3 gauss field is used and $C$ is 4 and the torquer switching threshold is $0.022 \unit{A \cdot m} ^2$ then $\omega_{th}$ is calculated as follows

\begin{equation}
    \omega _ {th} = { 0.022 \over{ {4 \cdot 0.3}}} = 0.0183 ~ \unit{rad / sec}
\end{equation}

To understand what the response of the \ac{ACDS} to a rotating magnetic field should be, a simulation was written. The simulation simply generates a magnetic field sequence and uses the B-dot algorithm to determine what the magnetic torque should be. The simulation quantizes the output torque but does not enforce the one flip per time step requirement.

%With the field set to $\omega_{th}$ a torquer should flip as $\dot{\vec{B}}$ becomes aligned with a torquer axis as the field continues to sweep the torquer will switch off.

\Cref{fig:detumble-sim} shows a simulation of the detumble algorithm in a spinning magnetic field. The field has a magnitude of 0.3~Gauss spins around the Z-axis. The gain of the simulated controller was -4. The plots show the magnetic dipole moment that the algorithm wants to drive and is able to drive as the magnetic field spins around.


\section{Detumble Flip Test}

To test the detumble algorithm on the \ac{ACDS} hardware the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$bdot_test$ function is used. A timer is used to update the magnetic field in the Helmholtz cage every half second. The field is set to a field that by default rotates around the Z-axis at 2~rpm. The \ac{ACDS} is set to operate in detumble mode and the data that the \ac{ACDS} outputs is captured.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=code,caption={Testing B-dot},label={lst:MSP-bdot},language=Matlab]
bdot_test('COM3',57600);
\end{lstlisting}

\Cref{lst:MSP-bdot} shows how to run the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$bdot_test$ function. The arguments are the same as for the \lstinline[style=code,language=Matlab]$tCalTstMSP_all$ function.

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{detumble-test}
  \caption{Test of the B-dot controller}
    \label{fig:detumble-test}
\end{figure}
\end{landscape}}

\Cref{fig:detumble-test} shows the results of the detumble test. This is the same as the detumble simulation in \cref{fig:detumble-sim} except the field has been programed into the Helmholtz cage, measured by the \acp{SPB}, calculations done by the \ac{ACDS} and torquers flipped in an attempt to stop the motion.

The results in \cref{fig:detumble-test} are similar to the results in the simulation in \cref{fig:detumble-sim}. The main difference is that there are some unexpected flips in the Z-axis. This is due to noise in the magnetic field causing torquers to be flipped. It is unclear if the noise is caused by the environment in the Helmholtz cage or by torquer flips and imperfect torquer calibration.
