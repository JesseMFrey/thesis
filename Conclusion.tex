\subsection{System Operations Overview}

\Cref{fig:sysopflow} shows the system operations flow. The code starts running after the separation switch is switched and the power system applies power to all systems. Before starting any operations the \ac{ACDS} waits for the on command from the \ac{CDH} board. After the \ac{ACDS} board receives the on command the \ac{ACDS} sends a command to the \ac{LEDL} board to tell it to start taking sensor data. Once sensor data is received the \ac{ACDS} starts to run the detumble algorithm. The Kalman filter needs to know the location of the satellite for it to operate properly so orbital elements must be uploaded before the Kalman filter can start running. Once the Kalman filter knows the location of the satellite it still needs some time to converge to a solution. During this time the \ac{ACDS} remains in detumble mode even if the rates have slowed enoughs to exit. Once the Kalman filter is locked and the rates have sufficiently slowed the \ac{ACDS} switches into mode 2. Mode two is run for a set number \todo{figure out how many and put the number here} of orbits (measured by timing). After mode 2 is complete Mode 3 starts. The \ac{ACDS} remains in mode 3 indefinably unless one of undesirable conditions is detected, see \cite{Mentch11} for details, which causes the \ac{ACDS} to attempt to kick the satellite out of the undesirable alignment and then re-stabilize by transitioning back to mode 2.

The flow case the flow from \cref{fig:sysopflow} can be disrupted. This can happen due to commands from the ground station or if the gyros detect that the sattelite is rotating too fast. The ground station can force the \ac{ACDS} into any mode and ether let it go with the normal flow or stay in a particular mode. This allows for recovery in case the system does not function as expected.

If the gyros detect that the satellite is rotating too fast then they will automatically send the \ac{ACDS} into a safe mode where the \ac{ACDS} does not run. It is possible that the \ac{ACDS} could get into a situation where the algorithm speeds up the rotation instead of slowing it down. In this situation the best thing to do is for the \ac{ACDS} to stop and wait for further intervention from the ground.

\subsubsection{Additional Ground station Commands}

In order for the Kalman filter to work it needs the orbital elements for the satellite. These must be uplinked from the ground because they change as the orbit decays. In addition gains for the control algorithm and Kalman filter may need to be changed in flight to account for unexpected conditions.

\subsubsection{Mode 2}

\Cref{fig:mode2} shows the Mode 2 torque algorithm block diagram. Torque is calculated the same way as in Mode 1 but this time a bias is added depending on which region of the orbit the satellite is in. The bias tends to cause the satellite to rotate. This causes the algorithm to cancel out the bias. This is prevented by preventing the resulting dipole moment from being in the opposite direction as the bias. Outside of the bias regions the torquers are set to produce no torque.

\subsubsection{Mode 3}

\Cref{fig:mode3} shows the Mode 3 torque algorithm block diagram. This is similar to Mode 2 except only the north pole bias window is used and outside the bias window torque is generated to slow rotation rates.
